                    A few steps from Lake Bolsena, Agiturismo Melona has five independent apartments and a double bedroom equipped with the necessary comforts to live a pleasant, relaxing experience. The structure is immersed in about 10 hectares of land with a wonderful and suggestive view of Lake Bolsena. Spread out in the surrounding park there are picnic areas, barbecues and shade pergolas. In addition to the private parking, there is a large private beach for the exclusive use of the guests of Agiturismo Melona, ​​equipped with sun loungers, where you can enjoy the serenity and peace that characterizes the Bolsena area. To reach the apartments, you go along an avenue of cypress trees and centuries-old olive trees, which distances the area of ​​the apartments from the main road. The friendly, serene and reserved atmosphere will characterize your stay.
<br><br>
In love with the area, the Cellarosi family takes care of the management of accommodation facilities located in the Bolsena area and surroundings. Roberto, Maria Rosaria and Arianna will take care of making your stay a pleasant experience with passion, dedication and care.
<br><br>
Agriturismo Melona is located about 3 km from the center of Bolsena, a delightful town in Alta Tuscia located directly on the shores of the lake of the same name. The structure, surrounded by greenery, qualifies as a strategic place both to reach centers of cultural, food and wine interest (e.g. Viterbo, Orvieto, Civita di Bagnoregio, Pitigliano etc.), as well as places of relaxation and spa areas.
